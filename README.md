# **Hotel Bookings Project in R**

## **Dataset**
The data in this project is originally from the article [Hotel Booking Demand Datasets](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191). To learn more about the dataset click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand).

## **Scenario**

In this scenario, I am a junior data analyst working for a hotel booking company. I have been asked to clean a .csv file that was created after querying a database to combine two different tables from different hotels. In order to learn more about this data, I am going to need to use functions to preview the data's structure, including its columns and rows. I will also need to use basic cleaning functions to prepare this data for analysis, and then create visualizations that highlight different aspects of the data to present to my stakeholder.

## **Steps**

### **1. Load Packages**

For this project, I used the following packages and libraries:

**_- "tidyverse"_**
**_- "skimr"_**
**_- "janitor"_**
**_- "rmarkdown"_**
**_- "readr"_**
**_-"dplyr"_**
**_-"ggplot2"_**

### **Step 2: Import Data**

I imported the data with **_read_csv()_** function.

### Step 3: Get to Know Data

Before I started cleaning my data, I took some time to explore it. I used several functions, including:

**_-"head()"_**
